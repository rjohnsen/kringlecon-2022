# 404 FTW

> The next attack is forced browsing where the naughty one is guessing URLs. What's the first successful URL path in this attack?

****

## Helpful hints

```
HTTP Status Codes
From: Alabaster Snowball
Objective: 404 FTW
With forced browsing, there will be many 404 status codes returned from the web server. Look for 200 codes in that group of 404s. This one can be completed with the PCAP or the log file.
```

## Solution

Wireshark query

```
http.response.code == 200 && ip.dst_host ==  18.222.86.32 && !(http.response_for.uri == "http://www.toteslegit.us/login.html")
```

This query yields 20 lines, so it was pretty trivial to traverse the result finding the URL path in question
