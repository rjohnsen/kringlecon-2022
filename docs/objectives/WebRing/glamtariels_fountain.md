#### Make sense of the clues

| Clue 			 | Text from game | Meaning |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| TAMPER         | Kringle really dislikes if anyone tries to TAMPER with the cookie recipe Glamtariel uses| | |
|       	         | I don't know why anyone would ever ask me to TAMPER with cookie recipe. I know just how Kringle likes them. | | |
| TRAFFIC FLIES  | From water and cold new ice form Frozen spires from lakes will arise. Those shivering who weather the storm will learn from how the TRAFFIC FLIES| Look at network traffic to see what is served from where. | 
| PATH           | I helped the elves create the PATH here to make sure that only those invited can find their way here.  | | 
|                | The elves do a great job making PATHs which are easy to follow once you see them  | |  
|                | Careful with the mountain! I know what you were wondering about there. It's no cause for concern. The PATH here is closed  | |       
| APP            | Between Glamtariel and Kringle, many who have tried to find the PATH here uninvited have ended up very disAPPpointed. Please click away that ominous eye!| | 
| TYPE           | Did you know that I speak many TYPEs of languages? For simplicity, I usually only communicate with this one though | |
|                | I pretty much stick to just one TYPE of language, it's a lot easier to share things that way | |
|                | You know, I've heard Glamtariel talk in her sleep about rings using a different TYPE of language. She may be more responsive about them if you ask differently. | |
| SIMPLE FORMAT  | I like to keep track of all my rings using a SIMPLE FORMAT, although I usually don't like to discuss such things | |
| RINGLIST       | Wow!, what a beautiful silver ring! I don't have one of these. I keep a list of all my rings in my RINGLIST file. Wait a minute! Uh, promise me you won't tell anyone. | |
|                | I never heard Glamtariel mention a RINGLIST file before. If only there were a way to get a peek at that. | | |
