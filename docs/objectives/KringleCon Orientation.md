### Talk to Jingle Ringford

### Get your badge

Clicking and talking to the elf releases a chain reaction which produces a badge. The badge itself is a great device that sticks onto the players stomach. Rubbing it yields access to hints and teleportation options, amongst other things.

### Create a wallet

Central in this edition of SANS Holiday Hack Challenge is cryptocurrency - for instance buying hats and NFT. For this the player need a wallet. A crypto wallet can be obtained by interacting with the ATM. First the player must create an account:

After the account has been made, the player will get a wallet:

It is vital to make note of the wallet adress and key. However, if this information is lost, the player can simply sneek behind the castle in the North Pole courtyard to retrieve this information. 

### Use the terminal

Before the player can enter the game fully there's one more obstacle to overcome -a Cranberry terminal. Luckily the guiding text leads the player through how to solve the terminal. In this case, just entering the word **"answer"**

### Talk to Santa

After all of this, the player can advance through the gate which leads to the North Pole courtyard. Here the player will meet Santa - which has a couple of things to say.
