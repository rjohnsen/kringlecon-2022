### Get your badge

Then we'll get our badge. Having a badge is great since you can rub your belly to access a menu to get hints, objectives and whatnots. Pay attention to the ATM machine, we'll interact with it in the next step. Also pay attention to the gates now being open and that a Cranberry terminal is now present.

### Create a wallet

By interating with the ATM we can create out crypotcoin wallet. First we create an account:
