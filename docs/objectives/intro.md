# Foreword

Finally - December is here again and so are the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge! 

Last year I won the Runner-Up Best Technical Answer - which certainly made my year! 



Life is circular - so is the year. It starts in January and ends with "SANS Holiday Hack Challenge" and "KringleCon". Then it repeats next year as a tradition - almost like Christmas itself.  

So, here we are - at the last month of 2022. A new edition of "SANS Holiday Hack Challenge" and "KringleCon" has arrived. As every year since many years ago, I joined the global cybersecurity community
in its most festive cyber security challenge and virtual conference of the year. I made my way through the challenges this year. Some were easy, some were hard and even some forced me to contact others
for assistance. Anyhow, this is my writeup for the objectives and terminals. It ainâ€™t much, but it is honest work and documents my way through the game step by step
