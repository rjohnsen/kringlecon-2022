# Foreword

So, we are finally here - at the last month of 2022. A new edition of "SANS Holiday Hack Challenge" and "KringleCon" has arrived. As every year since many years ago, I have joined the global cybersecurity community in its most festive cyber security challenge and virtual conference of the year. I have made my way through the challenges. Some were easy, some were hard - but all in all it was a fun ride with great variety! This is my writeup for the objectives and terminals. It ain’t much, but it is honest work and documents my way through the game step by step. New this year is that I have moved on from submitting my reports as just a PDF ref. the webcast last year ;)

And, thanks for the KringleCoin I won last year! :)
