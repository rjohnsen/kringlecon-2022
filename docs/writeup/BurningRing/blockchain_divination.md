# Blockchain Divination

```
Use the Blockchain Explorer in the Burning Ring of Fire to investigate the contracts and transactions on the chain. At what address is the KringleCoin smart contract deployed? Find hints for this objective hidden throughout the tunnels.
```

****

Upon opening the explorer, it displays information for block number 68869. Thinking the KringleCoin smart contract exists somewhere near the start of the block chain, I started investating block number 0 first.

Nope. Not here. Thinking the contract is still nearby I started investigating block number 1

And there it was! Scrolling down I found the address

Address is **0xc27A2D3DE339Ce353c0eFBa32e948a88F1C86554**
