## Assignments

### Talk to Jingle Ringford

The very first thing I needed to do was to talk to the elf "Jingle Rinford". This was done by simply moving closer and clicking on the elf.

### Get your badge

Clicking and talking to the elf released a chain reaction which produces a badge. The badge itself is a great device that sticks onto the players stomach. Rubbing it yields access to hints and teleportation options, amongst other things.

### Create a wallet

Central in this edition of SANS Holiday Hack Challenge is cryptocurrency - for instance buying hats and NFT. For this the player need a wallet. A crypto wallet can be obtained by interacting with the ATM. First I needed to create an account:

After the account had been made, I got a wallet:

It is vital to make note of the wallet adress and key. However, if this information is lost, the player can simply sneek behind the castle in the North Pole courtyard to retrieve this information. 

### Use the terminal

Before I could enter the game fully there was one more obstacle to overcome -a Cranberry terminal. Luckily the guiding text lead me through how to solve the terminal. In this case, just entering the word **"answer"**

### Talk to Santa

After all of this, I advanced through the gate which leads to the North Pole courtyard. Here I met Santa - which had a couple of things to say.

After talking to Santa I started to look around and found Ed Skoudis:
